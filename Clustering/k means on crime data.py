'''
Perform clustering for the crime data and identify the number of clusters

formed and draw inferences. Refer to crime data.csv dataset.

1. Business Problem

1.1. What is the business objective?
Crime Pattern Identification: Group states with similar crime rates to identify regional patterns or trends, which could help in allocating resources or targeting interventions.

Safety Indexing: Cluster states into groups based on safety levels (e.g., high-crime vs. low-crime states) for use in policy-making or public awareness campaigns.

Resource Allocation: Identify clusters of states with similar crime profiles to optimize the allocation of law enforcement resources.

Urbanization Impact Analysis: Analyze how the percentage of the urban population correlates with different crime rates by clustering states based on these factors.

Policy Effectiveness Evaluation: Group states to compare the effectiveness of different crime prevention policies across similarÂ clusters.

How to select value of k from elbow curve
when k changes from 2 to 3 , then decrease
in a is higher than 
when k chages from 3 to 4
when k changes from 3 to 4.
Whwn k value changes from 5 to 6 decreases
in a is higher than when k chages 3 to 4 .
When k values changes from 5 to 6 decrease
in a is considerably less , hence considered k=3
