3,Operates nicely. A bit small for the hand. Also if it's idle for sometime it gets into a sleep mode and needs to be activated again. Operates on a pencil cell.
4,"I recently recieved my ZEB-JAGUAR Wireless Mouse, and review it. This is a fantastic mouse ever under Rs= 300-/. According me, I can pay 500 for this as well. this is amazing. the connectivity distance is 13m that was surprised me.Maine ye mouse se jo expect kiya usse 10x time better nikla sach mai gajab hai ye chej yrr mai khta hun ankhein band karke order kardo agar iska price 500+ jata hai to because it deserve.And click is silent, aur aur to aur scroll feel gajab, DPI works well mai 2nd level use karta hu aur result very smooth. Connectivity mai no lag, no delay. But there is no cell in the box, you need AA cell to run.if you use normal cell it gives you 3-4 months backup performance and if you you duracell it gives you 5 months backup performance which are amazing. After 5 month this is still work i think it touch 6 month.Overall best segment mouse ever in 300 wireless category.You shoul buy."
5,Nice product. But first time booking product is not working scroll after exchange another one is working ok. Satisfactory
6,"First of all I'm really satisfied with this product, this mouse is a good choice if you are a student, the best thing I liked about this keyboard is it is silent, unlike other clicky mouses this one is very silent. the feedback we get from this mouse is also pretty good for a wireless mouse under 500, there is no delay when using."

9,it is very good and light weight
10,"While all else seems good about this product, the battery cover is loose and tends to come off even with the slightest touch. How durable the switch is will be known after prolonged use. I tend to switch off the mouse, to conserve battery, when I know I will not be using it for sometime and even when I log-off for the day. Affordably priced."
11,"the mouse performance  is good. i have just started using it. It is quite sensitive to movement. however i found two problems with it 1) the battery cover is loose.. in the very first usage you will come to know.  i need to use it more to know when the battery cover becomes so loose that i may need to use cellotape to fix it.2) the right and the left click buttons are too soft to use, we may feel the need to reclick as there is no sound of clicking. it may be good for some, but belive me i feel there should be proper click sound, or atleast a click feedback to be sure that we have clicked properlyHave said about the two minor drawbacks, i will still suggest this mouse as the price range is very economical for everyone.. also i want to request the company zebronics to kindly look into the above problems and rectify it as soon as possible"
